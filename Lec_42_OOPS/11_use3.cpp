// ‚úÖ 3. Using this Inside Non-Static Member Function

/*
üîç Purpose:

this is automatically available in non-static member functions to refer to the calling object.

This can be used to:

   : Access members of the current object
   : Return object address for method chaining
   : Print debugging info about the current object
