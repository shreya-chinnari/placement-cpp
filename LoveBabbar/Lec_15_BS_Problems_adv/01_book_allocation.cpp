/*
Given an array arr of integer numbers, where arr[i] represents the number of pages in the i-th book. There are n number of students and the task is to allocate all the books to these students.

Allocate books in such a way that:

   1 - Each student gets at least one book.
   2 - Each book should be allocated to a student.
   3 - Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.

You have to allocate the books to m students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimized.

Letâ€™s consider:

   n = 4 (number of books)
   m = 2 (number of students)
   arr = {10, 20, 30, 40}
