// The reason continue is not valid in a switch statement is because continue is designed specifically for loops, not for branching constructs like switch.
// continue is used inside loops (for, while, do-while) to skip the rest of the current iteration and jump to the next iteration of the loop.
// switch is a conditional branching statement that selects a block of code to run based on the value of an expression. Itâ€™s not a loop, so using continue directly in a switch (outside of a loop) will result in a compile - time error.
