/*
🔷 What is this in C++?

   In C++, this is a pointer that refers to the current object inside a class.

   So, when you're inside a class method, writing this->age means “the age member of the current object.”

✅ Why Use this?

You use this when:

   You want to resolve naming conflicts (e.g., parameter name same as member name).

   You want to return the current object from a method.

   You're inside a non-static member function.
