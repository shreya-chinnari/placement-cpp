🔷 What Is a Constructor?

   A constructor is a special function inside a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.

✅ Key Features:

   > Has the same name as the class.
   > No return type, not even void.
   > No input parameters
   > Can be overloaded (multiple constructors with different parameters).
   > Used to initialize object members at creation time.

🎯 Why Use a Constructor?

   Without a constructor, you would have to manually call setter functions (or assign directly) every time you create an object. Constructors automate and guarantee proper initialization.

   🔁 Without Constructor:

      Base obj;
      obj.setAge(25);
      obj.setName("Alice");
   
   ✅ With Constructor:

      Base obj(25, "Alice");  // Done in one line

⚙️ What Happens Behind the Scenes?

   When you write:
      Base obj(25, "Alice");

   The compiler:

      > Allocates memory for obj.
      > Automatically creates a default constructor of name "Base", 
      > Calls the matching constructor with parameters (25, "Alice").
      > Initializes the data members as per your constructor code.
      > Returns a fully constructed object.

   This ensures the object is ready for use immediately after creation.
