A copy constructor is a special constructor that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.

ClassName(const ClassName& other) {
    // copy logic
}

   - [other] is the object being copied.
   - const ensures the original object isn't modified.
   - [&] avoids copying it by value (which would call the copy constructor again ‚Üí infinite recursion).

üîç When Is a Copy Constructor Called?

Automatically called in these situations:

   1. Passing an object by value to a function.
   2. Returning an object by value from a function.
   3. Initializing an object from another:

      Hero h2 = h1;  // invokes copy constructor
      Hero h2(h1);   // invokes copy constructor
