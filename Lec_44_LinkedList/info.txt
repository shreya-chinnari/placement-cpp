Linked List in C++
------------------
   Definition: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

Advantages
-----------

   Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically during runtime.

   Ease of Insertion and Deletion: Insertions and deletions are straightforward and efficient, especially in comparison to arrays.

   No Wasted Memory: Memory allocation is flexible and efficient, using exactly as much memory as needed.

   Versatility: Various types of linked lists (singly, doubly, circular) offer different trade-offs between efficiency and ease of implementation.

Disadvantages
--------------

   Memory Overhead: Each node in a linked list requires additional memory for storing the reference to the next node.

   No Random Access: Accessing elements in a linked list is sequential and requires traversal from the beginning (or end), unlike arrays which allow direct indexing.

   Complexity: Implementing and debugging linked list operations can be more complex due to pointer management and potential for pointer-related errors.

   Cache Unfriendly: Unlike arrays, which benefit from locality of reference, linked lists may cause more cache misses due to scattered memory locations.


Linked lists are beneficial for scenarios requiring frequent insertions and deletions with an unknown number of elements. They provide flexibility in memory management but sacrifice direct access efficiency compared to arrays. Understanding these trade-offs helps in choosing the appropriate data structure based on specific application requirements.
