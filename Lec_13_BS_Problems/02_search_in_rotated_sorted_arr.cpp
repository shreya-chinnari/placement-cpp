// Search In Rotated Sorted Array

   Problem statement =>

You have been given a sorted array/list 'arr' consisting of ‘n’ elements. You are also given an integer ‘k’.
Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you.

For example, if 'arr' = [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 8], then after rotating 'arr' at index 3, the array will be 'arr' = [7, 8, 1, 3, 5].

Now, your task is to find the index at which ‘k’ is present in 'arr'.

   Note :
   1. If ‘k’ is not present in 'arr', then print -1.
   2. There are no duplicate elements present in 'arr'.
   3. 'arr' can be rotated only in the right direction.

   Example:
      Input: 'arr' = [12, 15, 18, 2, 4] , 'k' = 2
      Output: 3

   Explanation:
      If 'arr' = [12, 15, 18, 2, 4] and 'k' = 2, then the position at which 'k' is present in the array is 3 (0-indexed).

   Sample Input 1:
   4 3
   8 9 4 5
   Sample output 1:
   -1

   Explanation of Sample Output 1:
   For the test case, 3 is not present in the array. Hence the output will be -1.
